Note
I wanted to extend my sincere gratitude for giving me the opportunity to complete the technical test. I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project and was able to apply my skills in data retrieval and visualization.

I wanted to let you know that I chose to work with JavaScript instead of React, even though I am more familiar with React and TypeScript. I wanted to showcase my versatility and demonstrate my ability to work with different programming languages and technologies.

Thank you again for the opportunity to showcase my skills. I am looking forward to discussing the results with you and learning about the next steps.

Best regards,
Luna Smith

Plan
1. Create basics files
2. Retrieve data from the API 
3. Parse the retrieved data into a suitable format for a tabular representation
4. Create an HTML table to display the parsed data
5. Parse the retrieved data into a suitable format for graphical representation
6. Use a charting library to create visual representations of the data (Chart.js)
7. Test the resulting web page to ensure that the data is displayed correctly and that the page is functional
8. Style the project with SASS

Future plans:
1. Get faster by doing similar projects
2. Get better at testing the side ( perhaps using TDD)
3. Use a different library like React to achieve results faster.
4. Spend more time to bring this project to its full potential, with better graphics and visual effects.
